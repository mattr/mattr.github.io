What's this? Now I have two blogs that I can never update?

Yeah. So finally got around to setting up Github pages. I don't know what the breakdown will be, whether the programming posts will live solely here, or exist on both. Either way, it'll be a nice space for clearing my head with programming stuff.

Enjoy it as you will (or not, as the case may be).
